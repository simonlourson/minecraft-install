Go to our discord to get the server ip.

The server is almost completely Vanilla, the only mods installed are :

- [Lithium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium) for performance improvements

## Client install

If you don't want to use mods, nothing to do, just download minecraft 1.18 as usual !

If you want to use mods :

1. Download MultiMC :
